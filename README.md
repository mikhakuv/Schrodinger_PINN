This tool is designed to solve one-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equations using Physics-Informed Neural Networks technology, proposed by Raissi et al [1]. Although the basic approach remains same, many improvements are made:  
*  
*  
Moreover, plenty visualizations are available:  
*  
*  
2 problems are given as an example
Analytical solutions for considered nonlinear Schrodinger equations are described in [2] - second order and [3] - third order.
